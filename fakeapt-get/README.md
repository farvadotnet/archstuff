This is a (intentionally) very incomplete apt-get to pacman translator. It only handles the functions I use most often. Anything that I would have to look up is not included--I can look it up just as easily on Arch as I did on Debian. It does not translate option flags. Its purpose is to jog my memory, that's why it tells you the equivalent syntax. For safety reasons, the script asks before executing the command, just in case it's about to do something the user didn't intend. The implementation is very naive...it's only supposed to be an educational tool, not a professional grade tool.
